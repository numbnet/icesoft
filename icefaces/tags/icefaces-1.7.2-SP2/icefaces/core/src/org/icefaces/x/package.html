      NOTE: This package contains experimental ICEfaces classes and interfaces
      which are subject to change in the future.  They are provided here without
      warranty and without an expectation of backwards compatibility with future
      revisions.  Some of the classes and interfaces in this package may
      eventually be added in some form to the official ICEfaces packages and
      become supported, although no guarantee is made that this will occur.
      Classes and interfaces in these package may be substantially changed or
