/**
 * Because we are using a RequestDispatcher to bridge portlet handling into our servlet
 * based framework, we "lose" some of the characteristics of the Portlet API.  When
 * the dispatched call arrives at the ICEfaces MainServlet, the request and response
 * objects are wrapped as servlet versions and no longer accessible as portlet types.
 *
 * What we currently do, then, is save instances of those things that the portlet
 * developer might want to access and make them accessible on the other side of
 * the dispatched call.  This class is simply the envelope they are carried in.
