		<![CDATA[<p>The Repeat component provides a mechanism for dynamically generating 
		    a series of repeating child-components. The component itself doesn't renderer 
		    any markup but let its child components to render in an iterative fashion 
		    similar to way the panelSeries component renders data rows. 
            The difference between the panelSeries and the repeat component is that the 
            panelSeries render its children inside a panel and repeat component doesn't 
            render any markup of its own. The dataset can be defined and used by implementing the 
            value and var attributes respectively.
