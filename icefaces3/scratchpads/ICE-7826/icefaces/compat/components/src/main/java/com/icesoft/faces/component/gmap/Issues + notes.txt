For my own organization, or anyone else working on this.

Issues:
Needs to be re-updated to work smoothly with repeated updates. (eg, updating the bean when markers are bound to values from it produces multiple markers)

Services need to have an actual return. Wasn't sure of the best method for this. Currently just outputting values in an alert of proof of functionality.

Update 'style' attribute. Still left over from ice:gmap and unsure as to whether it's functional or merely confusing. Either case, should be redone.

Currently using eval() function. Bad press associated with it (cost/security) Workaround for it would probably be a good idea.

Housecleaning. Still a lot of garbage code from the old version laying around, and the descriptions need to be updated.

Possible extensions:
Major:
Google API features not yet implemented: MapTypes, Layers, Streetview, Events(?), Libraries. Events is top priority.
Implement a server-side geocode method to convert addresses to LatLngs for classes that only take points? (Ease of use + and restrictions down, makes program heavier.)
Minor:
Info Window for Markers?
Add a backdoor to marker creation in the services tag?
Overlay View
