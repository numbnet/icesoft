 * StateHolder is used to hold the complete state of a UIComponent, and so
 *  is used sparingly. UIData, which is used for iterative container
 *  components, only saves the EditableValueHolder fields. So, there's a
 *  huge gap inbetween, of being able to store fields when in an iterative
 *  container. This interface is used by our UISeries to manage non-UIData
 *  state that any component might require, without having to save everything.
