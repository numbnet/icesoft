	      <![CDATA[<p>The panelPopup is a container component that renders a window or panel that hovers on
            top of a web page. The popupPanel contains 2 regions which are defined using facets.
            The facet names are; header and body.<br>
            The panelPopup component can be used to provide a general popup window behavior such as moveable/dragable, resizeable and modal<br>
            Note: A panelPopup facet needs a container type component as a child (e.g.,
            panelGroup or panelGrid). panelGroup renders a span tag, which doesn't
            work properly if using Mozilla. panelGrid can be used to avoid display problems. ]]>
