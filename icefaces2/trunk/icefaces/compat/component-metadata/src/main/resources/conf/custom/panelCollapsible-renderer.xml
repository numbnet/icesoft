             <p>
                The panelCollapsible component is comprised of two parts: the 
                content area, where its children can be displayed; and a header 
                section, which can be clicked on, to cause the content area to 
                collapse into not being visible, or expand to become visible. 
                The panelCollapsible's state of being expanded or collapsed is 
                fully controllable via its expanded attribute, which can be tied 
                to a bean property through a ValueBinding.             
             </p>
