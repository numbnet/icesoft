        When partialSubmit=true, partialSubmitDelay is the number of 
        milliseconds before changes in selection will cause a partialSubmit 
        to occur. The intention being that when users use the keyboard to 
        navigate through potention options, to get to the intended option for 
        selection, that the rapid keypresses would not cause partialSubmits to 
        occur, for the interim selections, which slow down the process of 
        navigation. Default value is 300 milliseconds. To disable the delay,
        use -1.
