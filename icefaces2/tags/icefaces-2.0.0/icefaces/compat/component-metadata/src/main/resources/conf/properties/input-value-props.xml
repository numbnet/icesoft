        <![CDATA[<p>The current value of this component.</p>
        <p>All UIInput derived UIComponents, that are placed within a UIData 
        container, such as a dataTable or panelSeries, should have their 
        <i>value</i> attribute bound to a bean property via a 
        ValueBinding/ValueExpression, since otherwise the UIData container 
        will not keep their successfully validated state, which can cause 
        the component to fail to function properly.</p>]]>
