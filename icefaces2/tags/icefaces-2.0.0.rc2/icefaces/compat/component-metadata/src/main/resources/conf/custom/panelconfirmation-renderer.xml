        <p>This component renders a popup confirmation dialog asking the user
        whether to cancel or continue with the operation that was requested. This dialog
        will be displayed immediately after the event that triggered the operation (e.g.
        click, Enter-key press, etc.) while preventing the application from carrying out
        the requested operation until it is confirmed by the user.</p>
