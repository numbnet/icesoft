OK....so here's how the project started. 

Date: Jun 5th, 2007

- setup tables in MySQL (just for bidder and auctionitems since the bids would be generated after the application started, so that would be done differently) Also, decided to just use the classes for entities here (using Seam framework) just for looking at things....Since Yip mentioned perhaps not using hibernate, we might want to do things differently....see what they say later.

- ran icefaces-seam-gen to generate seam-auctionMontitor.  Now that we have the configuration files and the entity classes (in the model package) will do some manual changing of things.

-  changed everything over to hypersonice with an import.sql   Only the users and the auctionItems to be read in as the bidAction table will be generated through the application and start empty.

- used RegisterAction Class with register.xhtml but needs to be put in conversational scope

- to use what we have so far, just checkout the project and then build and deploy it.  Look at the AuctionItemsList link on the home page and that will show you a basic search and listing of what is currently in the table.  Will use this as a starting point for the seam-auctionMonitor application.

ToDo (for functional requirements)
- create a bid button in the table (instead of search) that is wired to the "loggedIn" session attribute and fires up the register/login page (need conversation propagation to bring back to current page) and allow edit of a bid column (we have to expand our table, or make some Transient attributes)

- include a confirmation (?) facelet within that conversation that confirms that their bid has been accepted???

Am I missing anything guys?
