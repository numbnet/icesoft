1.  Download jboss-seam (current version is 1.2.1.GA)
2.  Download icefaces jars  (you will require them in a folder with a /lib)
3.  This folder gets placed in the jboss-seam-1.2.1.GA folder (alongside reqular seam-gen folder)

It is recommended to use the JBoss Application Server 4.x.x server but like regular seam-gen the Apache Tomcat may be used with extra configuration (see the jboss-seam tutorial/documentation for this).

Use ant-setup to begin a new project.  This is identical to regular seam-gen(without icefaces) except for the addition of a prompt which requires you to enter the location of your icefaces home directory (must have a child that is /lib containing the icefaces jars).

Use ant new-project to create the new project directory with icefaces libraries and jars

Use ant freshen to update your icefaces jars when new binaries become available.

Use ant generate-entities to reverse-engineer from an existing database.

If you are using a database, ensure that your database-connection driver is also in your server libraries. (or generate-entities will work fine as this file is in your project/lib, but you won't be able to deploy your project).
