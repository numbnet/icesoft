
This ICEfaces demonstration application is designed for Spring 2.1 with Spring-webflow 1.0.4 or 1.0.5 

The destination directory for this project under these two releases is
different. Under 1.0.4 the checkout directory should be: 

\spring-framework-2.0.6\spring-webflow-1.0.4\projects\sellitem-icefacesDemo 


under 1.0.5 the checkout directory should be: 


\spring-framework-2.0.6\spring-webflow-1.0.5\projects\spring-webflow-samples\sellitem-icefacesDemo 


The file 'project.properties' should reflect the difference in relative directory depth in the 
following property: 

common.build.dir=${basedir}/../../common-build


The application is equipped with Ivy dependency resolution, so it will correctly update the necessary 
lib files wherever it is placed.
