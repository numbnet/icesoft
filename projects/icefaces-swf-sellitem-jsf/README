
This ICEfaces demonstration application is designed for Spring 2.1 with Spring-webflow 1.0.4 and 1.0.5. 
This project is meant to fit into the Spring build structure in the following location: 

{Spring-installation-directory}/spring-webflow-1.0.5/projects/spring-webflow-samples/


The project directory does not contain a version of ICEfaces. Obtain the current ICEfaces 
libs from http://www.icefaces.org/main/downloads/os-downloads.iface 

They are placed in the icefaces-swf-sellitem-jsf/lib/global directory. 

Build the project using one of several build targets in the Spring build ecosystem. With 
a few properties defined, you can deploy and manage a Tomcat installation from the 
ant build script. These properties are undefined in the checked in project, but 

ant clean war 

should deposit the project war file in the {project-directory}/target/artifacts/war directory. 

This target is suitable for Apache Tomcat 6.0.14.
