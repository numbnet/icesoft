    <h1>Welcome ! to the CallSetup Demo</h1>
    <br/>
    Converged Applications blend media and conferencing capabilities with the Java EE. Here we blend Sip Servlets with Http Servlets, Java Persistence API, Annotations etc.
    This sample application provides a registry where online users publish their contact addresses. A web interface allows anyone to browse the database of currently online users and place a call between two selected users. 
    You can start calls between any two people! The demo runs on SailFin V1 !
    Click <a href="./RegistrationBrowserServlet">List of Registered Users</a> to get started!
    <p>
    Demo was made possible by: Kristoffer Grownowski, Per Petersson, Mahesh Kannan, Hong Zhang, Sreeram Duvur, Jeanfrancois Arcand, Prasad Subramanian
