      <h1>How to Create an Application Using Hibernate</h1>
      
      <p>
          Hibernate is a powerful, high performance object/relational 
          persistence and query service. Hibernate lets you develop persistent 
          classes following object-oriented idiom - including association, 
          inheritance, polymorphism, composition, and collections. Hibernate 
          allows you to express queries in its own portable SQL extension (HQL),
          as well as in native SQL, or with an object-oriented Criteria and 
          Example API. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
          For this tutorial we will be using the Student Registration example 
          application.  This applications main function is to add, update, and 
          delete students from the database.  Additional functionality includes 
          being able to register courses to a student, this will help to show 
          how Hibernate treats relationships between classes in the database.  
      </p>
      
      <p>
          This tutorial gives a basic idea on how to connect and use Hibernate 
          with a database.  Hibernate has many other functions and uses that go 
          beyond this tutorial.  A good resource is the Hibernate web site's 
          documentation.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          NOTE: This application uses a MySQL database therefore an up-to-date 
          instance of MySQL is needed to run.  The sql script to create and 
          populate the database is included in the /sqlScripts directory.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          This tutorial will discuss the following topics related to using

      <h2>Steps to Create a Hibernate Application</h2>
      
      <p>
          The following steps will guide you on how to create a 
          Hibernate application.  We will be using the Student Register 
          application to demonstrate the major steps.  Before you begin you 
          should or will have to download the latest Hibernate release  from
          <a href="http://www.hibernate.org" target="_blank">www.hibernate.org</a> 
          and include the jar files in the /lib directory of 
          the download to your projects /lib directory.

      <h3>Step 1: Create the Java Objects</h3>
      
      <p>
          The great feature about using Hibernate is that your java objects do 
          not need any special treatment to become persistent.  Below is and 
          example of the code used for the Student object in the Student 
          Register application.
      </p>
      
      <pre>
            package com.icesoft.icefaces.tutorial.crud.hibernate;

            import java.util.HashSet;
            import java.util.Set;
            
            /**
             * Represents a student object in the hibernate tutorial
             * Student Register example.
             */
            public class Student {
                // unique student id
                private int studentId;
                // first name of the student
                private String firstName;
                // last name of the student
                private String lastName;
                // address of the student
                private String address;
                // set of courses that the student is related/registered for
                private Set courses = new HashSet();

                public Student() {
                }

                /**
                 * Creates a new instance of Student.
                 * @param firstName first name.
                 * @param lastName last name.
                 * @param address address.
                 */
                public Student(String firstName, String lastName, String address){
                    this.firstName = firstName;
                    this.lastName = lastName;
                    this.address = address;
                }

                public int getStudentId(){
                    return studentId;
                }

                public void setStudentId(int studentId){
                    this.studentId = studentId;
                }

                public String getFirstName(){
                    return firstName;
                }

                public void setFirstName(String firstName){
                    this.firstName = firstName;
                }

                public String getLastName(){
                    return lastName;
                }

                public void setLastName(String lastName){
                    this.lastName = lastName;
                }

                public String getAddress(){
                    return address;
                }

                public void setAddress(String address){
                    this.address = address;
                }

                public Set getCourses(){
                    return courses;
                }
                
                public void setCourses(Set courses){
                    this.courses = courses;
                }

                public String clear(){
                    firstName="";
                    lastName="";
                    address="";
                    return "clear";
                }
            }

      </pre>
      
      <p>
          As you can see it is pretty straight forward.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 2: Create the Mapping Files for the Java Objects</h3>
      
      <p>
          For an object to be persisted to a database, Hibernate needs a mapping 
          file for all of the objects that are to be persisted.  This XML file 
          lets Hibernate know how to load and store objects, what table in the 
          database it has to access, and what columns in the table it should 
          use.  The following is an example mapping file from the Student 
          Register application.
      </p>
      
      <pre>
            &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
            &lt;!DOCTYPE hibernate-mapping PUBLIC
                "-//Hibernate/Hibernate Mapping DTD 3.0//EN"
                "http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-mapping-3.0.dtd"&gt;

            &lt;hibernate-mapping&gt;
                &lt;class name="com.icesoft.icefaces.tutorial.crud.hibernate.Student" table="students"&gt;
                    &lt;id name="studentId" column="student_id"&gt;
                        &lt;generator class="increment"/&gt;
                    &lt;/id>

                    &lt;property name="firstName" column="first_name"/&gt;
                    &lt;property name="lastName" column="last_name"/&gt;
                    &lt;property name="address"/>
                    &lt;set name="courses" table="student_courses"&gt;
                        &lt;key column="student_id"/&gt;
                        &lt;many-to-many column="course_id" class="com.icesoft.icefaces.tutorial.crud.hibernate.Course"/&gt;
                    &lt;/set&gt;
                &lt;/class&gt;

            &lt;/hibernate-mapping&gt;
      </pre>
      
      <p>
          The file must be saved with the hbm.xml extension.  This lets 
          Hibernate know that this is a mapping file.  The file location must 
          be in the same directory as the java file it is related to.  Also be 
          sure to add the Hibernate DTD at the top of the page for all mapping 
          files.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Inside the hibernate-mapping tags is where all the mapping information
          will be included.  The first element to be added is the class element.
          This will map a persistent class to a table in the database.  With the
          class element you must define the name and table attributes.  The name
          attribute will let Hibernate know the name of the Java class that you want 
          to be persisted.  The table attribute specifies the name of the table 
          to be used in the database when persisting the Java object for this mapping.  
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Inside the class element is where you define the attributes of your 
          Java object to columns in the database.  The following is a 
          description of the commonly used ones and their attributes:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
          <li>
              <b>&lt;id&gt;</b> - When your mapping a Java object to a database an 
              ID is required.  This helps to eliminate any duplicate entries.
          </li>
          <ul>
              <li><i>name</i> - Specifies the name of the id.</li>
              <li><i>column</i> - The name of the database column for the id.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>
              <b>&lt;generator&gt;</b> - This element is actually a sub-element 
              of the <i>id</i> element.  It is used to generate a unique id every time 
              an object is persisted to the database.  It also specifies how the
              id element will be created by using the following built in 
              generators:
          </li>
          <ul>
              <li>
                  <i>increment</i> - Used most often, each time the generator 
                  needs a new id it performs a select on the database to 
                  determine the current largest id and increments it to the 
                  next value.
              </li>
              <li>
                  <i>native</i> - Picks the best strategy depending on the 
                  configured database.
              </li>
              <li>
                  <i>assigned</i> - Used if you need to assign the id yourself 
                  in your application.  Set the id by using the 
                  set&lt;identifier&gt; method of the Java class.  The 
                  application assumes responsibility on keeping the id unique.
              </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
              <b>&lt;property&gt;</b> - For every attribute in your Java class 
              that you want persisted you need to define one of these tags for 
              each one.  The following are some commonly used attributes for 
              the <i>property</i> element:
          </li>
          <ul>
              <li>
                  <i>name</i> - Specifies the name of the property.  The first 
                  character must be lowercase.
              </li>
              <li>
                  <i>column</i> - Specifies the name of the column in the 
                  database that the attribute will be saved.
              </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
              <b>&lt;set&gt;</b> - The most common collection mapping used in 
              Hibernate.  
          </li>
          <ul>
              <li>
                  <i>name</i> - Specifies the name of the set used in the Java 
                  class.
              </li>
              <li>
                  <i>table</i> - Specifies the name of the table to be used for 
                  the collection.  In our example we have a many-to-many 
                  relationship with Student and Course.  Therefore an 
                  association table needs to be used.
              </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
              <b>&lt;key&gt;</b> - Sub-element of <i>set</i>. Used to indicate the property of the class.
          </li>
          <ul>
              <i>column</i> - Specifies the foreign key column.
          </ul>
          <li>
              <b>&lt;many-to-many&gt;</b> - Sub-element of <i>set</i>.  Used to define 
              the other class in the many-to-many relationship. 
          </li>
          <ul>
              <li>
                  <i>column</i> - Specifies the column name of the other class.
              </li>
              <li>
                  <i>class</i> - Specifies the path of the other class.
              </li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
          There are of course many more elements and attributes that can be 
          used.  A few of them will be explain in brief detail later in the 
          tutorial.

      <h3>Step 3: Create the Hibernate Configuration File</h3>
      
      <p>
          Once the mapping files for the persistent objects have been completed,
          its now time to configure Hibernate.  This will have all the 
          information to connect Hibernate to a database.  First we will need a 
          database.  For our example we used MySQL but there are many other 
          databases that will work with Hibernate including:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
          <li>MySQL</li>
          <li>HSQL DB</li>
          <li>Oracle</li>
          <li>MS SQL Server</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Consult with the Hibernate website to find an up-to-date listing.</p>
      
      <p>
          To configure Hibernate there are a few ways that it can be done, you
          can use a simple hibernate.properties file, a more sophisticated 
          hibernate.cfg.xml file, or a complete programmatic setup.  For our 
          application we will use the XML configuration file.
      </p>
      
      <pre>
          &lt;!DOCTYPE hibernate-configuration PUBLIC
          "-//Hibernate/Hibernate Configuration DTD 3.0//EN"
          "http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-configuration-3.0.dtd"&gt;
        
            &lt;hibernate-configuration&gt;

                &lt;session-factory&gt;

                    &lt;!-- Database connection settings --&gt;
                    &lt;property name="connection.driver_class"&gt;org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver&lt;/property&gt;
                    &lt;property name="connection.url"&gt;jdbc:mysql://localhost/register&lt;/property&gt;
                    &lt;property name="connection.username"&gt;test&lt;/property&gt;
                    &lt;property name="connection.password"&gt;test&lt;/property&gt;

                    &lt;!-- SQL dialect -->
                    &lt;property name="dialect"&gt;org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLInnoDBDialect&lt;/property&gt;

                    &lt;!-- Echo all executed SQL to stdout --&gt;
                    &lt;property name="show_sql"&gt;true&lt;/property&gt;

                    &lt;property name="current_session_context_class"&gt;thread&lt;/property&gt;

                    &lt;mapping resource="com/icesoft/icefaces/tutorial/crud/hibernate/Course.hbm.xml"/&gt;
                    &lt;mapping resource="com/icesoft/icefaces/tutorial/crud/hibernate/Student.hbm.xml"/&gt;

                &lt;/session-factory&gt;

            &lt;/hibernate-configuration&gt;        
      </pre>
      
      <p>
          Note that this configuration uses a different DTD than the mapping 
          files.  All of the properties are inside the session-factory tags.  
          The first four property elements contain the configuration for the 
          MySQL connection.  The dialect property element specifies the 
          particular SQL variant Hibernate generates.  The show_sql property 
          element will, when set to true, output all the SQL commands to the 
          console window.  At the end is where the mapping files are included 
          to the configuration.  
      </p>
      
      <p>
          The location of the file must be at the source directories root, 
          Hibernate automatically looks for a file called hibernate.cfg.xml in 
          the root of the class path on startup.
      </p>

          Now a helper class is needed to get Hibernate up and running.  This 
          class creates a SessionFactory object which in turn can open up new 
          Session's.  A session is a single-threaded unit of work, the 
          SessionFactory is a thread-safe global object instantiated once.  For 
          our application the HibernateUtil class is implemented below:
      </p>
      
      <pre>
          package com.icesoft.icefaces.tutorial.crud.hibernate.util;

          import org.hibernate.SessionFactory;
          import org.hibernate.cfg.Configuration;

          public class HibernateUtil {
    
                private static final SessionFactory sessionFactory;

                static {
                    try {
                        // Create the SessionFactory from hibernate.cfg.xml
                        sessionFactory = new Configuration().configure().buildSessionFactory();
                    } catch (Throwable ex) {
                        // Make sure you log the exception, as it might be swallowed
                        System.err.println("Initial SessionFactory creation failed." + ex);
                        throw new ExceptionInInitializerError(ex);
                    }
                }

                public static SessionFactory getSessionFactory() {
                    return sessionFactory;
                }

          }
      </pre>
      
      <p>
          Place HibernateUtil.java in a util package next to your main class package(s).
      </p>
      
      <a name="stepfive">&nbsp;</a>
      
      <h3>Step 5: Create a Class to use Persistence Objects</h3>
      
      <p>
          Now that the mapping and configuration files have been written its 
          time to use the persistent objects in our application.  Using 
          Hibernate you can add, edit, delete objects to and from a database.  
          In the Student Register example we use one class that facilitates all 
          the functionality called RegisterManager.java.  The following code 
          portion from the RegisterManager class shows how we add a student to 
          the database:
      </p>
      
      <pre>
          public void addStudent(ActionEvent event){
                Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().getCurrentSession();
                session.beginTransaction();
        
                Student s = newStudent;
        
                session.save(s);
        
                session.getTransaction().commit();
        
                s.clear();
                init();
         }
      </pre>
      
      <p>
          First off we create a new Session instance which is returned from our 
          helper class HibernateUtil.  By getting it from the helper class we 
          can be sure that only one thread is running at one time.  You can, if 
          your application deems it needed, create one or more Sessions with 
          each one representing a single unit of work.  The Hibernate Session 
          object has many different methods that can be used to manipulate data 
          to and from a database.  In our addStudent() method we use the 
          session.save(s) method.  This actually creates an SQL command to 
          insert the new student object into the database.  After the object is 
          saved the Session is then committed and closed.  
      </p>
      
      <p>
          How do read values from the database?  Below is an example from the 
          Student Register application:
      </p>
      
      <pre>
          private synchronized void init(){
                ...
                Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().getCurrentSession();
                session.beginTransaction();
        
                List studentResult = session.createQuery("select s.studentId from " +
                        "Student as s").list();
                List courseResult = session.createQuery("select c.courseName from " +
                        "Course as c").list();        
                session.getTransaction().commit();
                studentItems.add(new SelectItem(""));
                ...
         }
      </pre>
      
      <p>
          The init() method creates a new session just like the addStudent() 
          method, the only difference is that it uses the createQuery() method.  
          This method is used to send SQL/HQL commands to the database.  It then
          returns a list of the information that it found in the database 
          leaving it open to be used how you please.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          So far we have touched on how to use Session's methods to 
          automatically add an object to the database without needing to write 
          any sql commands.  Also how to write your own SQL command to access 
          the database.  Another subject that we will touch on is using a named 
          parameter.  In our example application we use this a few times.  The 
          following code is from the RegisterManager class's deleteStudent() 
          method:
      </p>
      
      <pre>
          public void deleteStudent(ActionEvent event){
                if(currentStudent != null){
                    int id = currentStudent.getStudentId();
                    Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory()
                                                    .getCurrentSession();
                    session.beginTransaction();
                    Query q = session.createQuery("delete from Student as s where " +
                            "s.studentId =:id");
                    q.setInteger("id",id);
                    int rowCount = q.executeUpdate();
                    session.getTransaction().commit();
                    System.out.println("Rows affected: " + rowCount);
                    currentStudent.clear();
                    studentItems.clear();
                    init();
                }
          }
      </pre>
      
      <p>
          The method gets a Session like before but we now want to delete the 
          student that has the value of id that was set before we created the 
          Session object.  To include a named parameter it must start with the 
          colon character (<b>:</b>).  As you can see in the above code we create a 
          Query object to execute the SQL command.  With the Query we set the 
          named parameter so that Hibernate can use it.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Note that we call the executeUpdate() method to execute an update or 
          delete statement.  It also returns the row count of affected rows, 
          which can help in debugging.

      <h2>Other Mapping Elements</h2>
      
      <p>
          The following is a short listing of some other Hibernate mapping 
          elements and a brief description of what they do:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
          <li><b>&lt;composite-id&gt;</b> - Used with a table with a composite key id.</li>
          <li><b>&lt;version&gt;</b> - Used on tables that contain versioned data.</li>
          <li><b>&lt;timestamp&gt;</b> - Used on tables that contain timestamped data.</li>
          <li><b>&lt;join&gt;</b> - Makes it possible to map properties of one class to several tables.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
          These are only a small portion of the many mapping elements available.

      <h2>Class Associations In Hibernate</h2>
      
      <p>
          In our Student Register example the Student holds a set of Course 
          objects.  These Course objects are the courses that the student has 
          registered for.  Also each Course object also holds a set of Student 
          objects which is made up of the Students that are registered in each 
          course.  This relationship is called a many-to-many relationship.  
      </p>
      
      <p>
          In a many-to-many relationship an association table is needed to hold 
          the values for the relationship.  This table is mapped in the Student 
          and Course mapping files with the following code:
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Student.hbm.xml
      </p>
      
      <pre>
          ...
          &lt;set name="courses" table="student_courses"&gt;
             &lt;key column="student_id"/&gt;
             &lt;many-to-many column="course_id" class="com.icesoft.icefaces.tutorial.crud.hibernate.Course"/&gt;
          &lt;/set&gt;
          ...
      </pre>
      
      <p>
          Course.hbm.xml
      </p>
      
      <pre>
          ...
          &lt;set name="students" table="student_courses"  inverse="true"&gt;
             &lt;key column="course_id"/&gt;
             &lt;many-to-many column="student_id" class="com.icesoft.icefaces.tutorial.crud.hibernate.Student"/&gt;
          &lt;/set&gt;
          ...
      </pre>
      
      <p>
          Once the mapping of the association table has been completed, we will 
          now need to use these values.  In our example we can add and remove 
          courses assigned to a student.  This data is saved in the association 
          table under the students id and the course id.  The following is the 
          code used to add and remove a course from a student:
      </p>
      
      <pre>
          ...
          public void addCourseToStudent(ActionEvent event){
                Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().
                                                    getCurrentSession();
                session.beginTransaction();

                Student s = (Student)session.load(Student.class, 
                                            currentStudent.getStudentId());
                Course c = (Course)session.load(Course.class, 
                                            currentCourse.getCourseId());

                s.getCourses().add(c);
                setStudentCourses();
                session.getTransaction().commit();
         }
         ...
         public void removeCourseFromStudent(ActionEvent event){
                Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().getCurrentSession();
                session.beginTransaction();
        
                Student s = (Student)session.load(Student.class, 
                                            currentStudent.getStudentId());
                Course c = (Course)session.load(Course.class, 
                                            currentCourse.getCourseId());
                s.getCourses().remove(c);
                setStudentCourses();
                session.getTransaction().commit();
        }
        ...
      </pre>
      
      <p>
          As you can see we start the methods like our other ones.  The only 
          major difference is we load the current Student and Course objects.  
          Once they are loaded we then get the set of courses and now can use 
          its add() or remove() methods.  Hibernate automatically detects that 
          the collection has been modified and needs to be updated, meaning we 
          do not have to call an update() or save() method.  This is called 
          automatic dirty checking.  The only catch is that the objects need to 
          be loaded in the current session.
