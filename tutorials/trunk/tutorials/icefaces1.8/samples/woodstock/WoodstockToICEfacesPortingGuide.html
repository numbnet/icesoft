<h2>Woodstock to ICEfaces Porting Guide<br>
</h2>
<p>This document will guide you through the process of porting Woodstock
applications to ICEfaces.&nbsp; The porting process is devised to be
evolutionary in nature, allowing you to maintain a functional Woodstock
application, while incrementally porting Woodstock pages to
ICEfaces.&nbsp; The ultimate goal of the porting process is to entirely
eliminate Woodstock from the application, leaving you with a pure
ICEfaces application where you can take full advantage of all the rich
features provided in the ICEfaces framework.<br>
<br>
The migration support in ICEfaces is based on project-level coexistence
with Woodstock, which means ICEfaces and Woodstock pages can
coexist in the same web application.&nbsp; The approach is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</span> intended to support page-level
coexistence of ICEfaces and Woodstock, where components from both
frameworks are included in the same
page.&nbsp; That being said, subsequent releases of ICEfaces will
include selectively ported Woodstock components that will exist as
first-class citizens of the ICEfaces framework.&nbsp; The availability
of these components will ease the page-level porting effort, but not
eliminate it.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The majority of Woodstock applications are based on the Visual JSF
project type in NetBeans, so this guide focuses on this particular
migration path.&nbsp; If your application leverages Woodstock in some
other programming model like Facelets, most of the concepts presented
here will still apply.&nbsp; The guide is presented in three parts.<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="PortingGuidePart1.html">Part 1</a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>covers all the basics related to
the porting process, including:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Adding the ICEfaces plugins to NetBeans</li>
    <li>Adding ICEfaces to an existing Woodstock application</li>
    <li>Refactoring the data model to eliminate component bindings<br>
    </li>
    <li>Adding ICEfaces pages to an existing Woodstock application</li>
    <li>Component by component porting of a Woodstock page to ICEfaces</li>
    <li>Navigation between ICEfaces and Woodstock Pages</li>
    <li>Leveraging Automatic Ajax features in ICEfaces<br>
      <br>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <li><a href="PortingGuidePart2.html">Part 2</a> focuses on issues
      related to porting data tables, including:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Eliminating component bindings</li>
    <li>Creating an ICEfaces data table</li>
    <li>Porting the working example to use the new data table</li>
    <li>Modifying the navigation</li>
    <li>Working with sortable headers in the data table<br>
      <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li><a href="PortingGuidePart3.html">Part 3</a> examines Single Page
    Interfaces and illustrates techniques in ICEfaces to achieve
    them, including:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>ICEfaces Extended Request Scope</li>
    <li>Row Selector in Data Table</li>
    <li>Using the ICEfaces rendered Attribute</li>
    <li>Using ice:panelStack</li>
    <li>Multiple View Support<br>
      <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
