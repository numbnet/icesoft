    <b>Lesson:</b> Using the panelPopup component
</p>

<!-- introduction section -->
<h1>How to Use the ICEfaces Panel Popup Component</h1>

<p>
The <span class="object-name">panelPopup</span> component can be used to display
various types of content inside a draggable or modal dialog. These dialogs can be
used on pages to display important information and options to the user in a manner
similar to a standalone offline application.
</p><p>
The draggable popup panel can be moved around the page while still allowing interaction
with the underlying page. The modal popup panel cannot be moved, and prevents page
interaction by applying a partially transparent gray overlay. The following screenshot is
of the <span class="object-name">ice:panelPopup</span> component demo in component-showcase. Notice
the draggable dialog covered by the modal popup.
</p>

<div class="screenshot">
    <img src="images/popup_showcase_screenshot.png"
       title="panelPopup component in Component Showcase application"
         alt="panelPopup component in Component Showcase application" width="788" height="816"/>
</div>

<p>
The <span class="object-name">panelPopup</span> does not require any beans specific to the application.
For example, static text can be used inside the body using only page level tools, which removes the complexity
of bean setup. In the case of each example in this tutorial, a backing bean will only be used for the advanced demo.
</p>

<a name="draggableBasic"><h2>Creating a Draggable Panel Popup</h2></a>

<p>
The creation of a draggable <span class="object-name">panelPopup</span> is simple and does not require any backend code or beans.
In this next example the page contains a single draggable <span class="object-name">panelPopup</span> with 2 <span class="object-name">
outputText</span> components inside the body.
</p><p>
The <span class="object-name">panelPopup</span> component has 2 available facets (header and body) that can be filled and styled with content. The general
layout of the <span class="object-name">panelPopup</span> code is therefore similar to:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;f:facet name="header"&gt;
        &lt;!-- header content would go here --&gt;
    &lt;/f:facet&gt;

    &lt;f:facet name="body"&gt;
        &lt;!-- body content would go here --&gt;
    &lt;/f:facet&gt;
</pre>

<p>
In this tutorial both facets contain <span class="object-name">outputText</span> components, although it is possible to place other extended or
custom components inside the popup panel. It is recommended that anything inside the facet be wrapped in either an <span class="object-name">ice:panelGroup
</span> or <span class="object-name">ice:panelGrid</span>.
</p>
<p>
The facets would then be placed inside the <span class="object-name">ice:panelPopup</span> tag. Because this section is demonstrating a draggable
<span class="object-name">panelPopup</span>, the <span class="object-name">draggable="true"</span> attribute is added to the tag. This results in
the following code:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;ice:panePopup draggable="true"&gt;
        &lt;f:facet name="header"/&gt;
        &lt;f:facet name="body"/&gt;
    &lt;/ice:panelPopup&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The example page has added content inside the facets, as well as some minor styling to each component. Once completed, the draggable example looks similar
to:
</p>

<div class="screenshot">
    <img src="images/draggable-tutorial_screenshot.png"
       title="Draggable Panel Popup Example"
         alt="Draggable Panel Popup Example" width="511" height="479"/>
</div>

<p>
The creation of this draggable dialog was very simple, as the <span class="code-jsf">
draggablePanelPopup.jspx</span> shows.
</p>

<div class="demo-instruction">
    <h3>Download the demo:</h3>
    <ul>
<li>Download the panelPopup-draggable source code <a href="panelPopup-draggable-tutorial.zip">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
The modal <span class="object-name">panelPopup</span> is implemented in a similar manner to the draggable version, as the next tutorial will demonstrate.
</p>

<!-- tutorial: panelPopup-modal -->
<a name="modalBasic"><h2>Creating a Modal Panel Popup</h2></a>

<p>
The second option for a <span class="object-name">panelPopup</span> is a modal approach. The modal dialog displays a partially transparent gray overlay
around the <span class="object-name">panelPopup</span>, which disables interaction with the page. This can be used to display critical messages that
the user must acknowledge before continuing. The guidelines for a modal <span class="object-name">panelPopup</span> are the same as the <a href="#draggableBasic">
draggable</a> version above. The only difference is the <span class="object-name">modal="true"</span> attribute which must be set in the
<span class="object-name">panelPopup</span> tag, as shown below:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;ice:panelPopup modal="true"/&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Using the draggable page as a basis, the new page <span class="code-jsf">
modalPanelPopup.jspx</span> can be created easily. When viewed, the page appears similar to:
</p>

<div class="screenshot">
    <img src="images/modal-tutorial_screenshot.png"
       title="Modal Panel Popup Example"
         alt="Modal Panel Popup Example" width="640" height="446"/>
</div>

<p>Notice the blocking mechanism of the modal dialog, and also how the <span class="object-name">panelPopup</span> cannot be dragged.</p>

<div class="demo-instruction">
    <h3>Download the demo:</h3>
    <ul>
<li>Download the panelPopup-modal source code <a href="panelPopup-modal-tutorial.zip">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
The appearance of these 2 examples is rather generic and may not suit your application. The next section will demonstrate how to
customize the CSS for <span class="object-name">panelPopup</span>.
</p>

<!-- tutorial: panelPopup-style -->
<a name="customizingStyle"><h2>Customizing Panel Popup Styles</h2></a>

<p>
The popup styles can be customized by overriding the default CSS values. The first step is to create a new stylesheet and link to it in <span class="code-jsf">
stylePanelPopup.jspx</span>, as shown in the line below:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;link href="./override.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Next the default panel styles should be copied into the override sheet. To find the default styles, look inside the CSS normally linked to, which is
./xmlhttp/css/xp/xp.css. Copy all tab related styles into a new sheet, in our case <span class="code-jsf">
override.css</span>.
</p>

<p>
After this is done, you can begin customizing the styles. This demonstration changes the colors and borders of the header and body facet, as well
as the <span class="object-name">panelPopup</span> itself. The result is similar to the following:
</p>

<div class="screenshot">
    <img src="images/style-tutorial_screenshot.png"
       title="Style Panel Popup Example"
         alt="Style Panel Popup Example" width="671" height="532"/>
</div>

<p>
To achieve the color change of the <span class="object-name">panelPopup</span> header, the following CSS changes were used:
</p>

<pre>
.icePnlPopHdr {
    background-color: #FF0000;
    color: #FFFFFF;
    text-align: center;
}
</pre>

<p>
Other CSS changes were done to help display the possibilities, and since all the relevant classes are accessible the <span class="object-name">
panelPopup</span> style can be completely changed.
</p>

<div class="demo-instruction" >
    <h3>Download the demo:</h3>
    <ul>
<li>Download the panelPopup-style source code <a href="panelPopup-style-tutorial.zip">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>As was mentioned earlier, complex components can be used inside of the <span class="object-name">panelPopup</span>, and backing beans
can be added to increase the functionality. The next tutorial will demonstrate both of these functions.</p>

<!-- tutorial: panelPopup-advanced -->
<a name="draggableAdvanced"><h2>Advanced Draggable Panel Popup</h2></a>

<p>
This tutorial will focus on 2 features of <span class="object-name">panelPopup</span> not previously covered. The first is the
ability to have complex components inside the dialog, and the second is adding a backing bean and dynamic functionality.
</p>

<p>
Placing a new component inside the <span class="object-name">panelPopup</span> is done by adding their tags, as shown below.
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;f:facet name="body"&gt;
        &lt;ice:inputText value="Input Text"/&gt;
        &lt;ice:selectBooleanCheckbox value="true"/&gt;
        &lt;ice:outputLink value=""&gt;
            &lt;ice:outputText value="Output Link"/&gt;
        &lt;/ice:outputLink&gt;
        &lt;ice:selectInputDate/&gt;
    &lt;/f:facet&gt;
</pre>

<p>
This would result in the dialog body containing an inputText, checkbox, link, and calendar. This demonstrates how flexible the contents of the popup panel
can be. With this set of components inside the <span class="object-name">panelPopup</span>, the page appears similar to:
</p>

<div class="screenshot">
    <img src="images/advanced-tutorial_screenshot.png"
       title="Advanced Panel Popup Example"
         alt="Advanced Panel Popup Example" width="635" height="623"/>
</div>

<p>
This section also demonstrates how to use backing beans with this component. As you can see from the screenshot, a close button
(appears as <img src="../panelPopup-advanced/web/images/close.gif"/>) has been added. This close button acts as a toggle to change
the visibility of the <span class="object-name">panelPopup</span>.
</p>

<p>
The bean PopupBean.java is used, and is bound in <span class="object-name">faces-config</span> in the standard way (shown below for reference):
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;managed-bean&gt;
        &lt;managed-bean-name&gt;popup&lt;/managed-bean-name&gt;
        &lt;managed-bean-class&gt;
            com.icesoft.icefaces.tutorial.component.panelPopup.advanced.PopupBean
        &lt;/managed-bean-class&gt;
        &lt;managed-bean-scope&gt;session&lt;/managed-bean-scope&gt;
    &lt;/managed-bean&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Once this is done, a <span class="object-name">visible</span> attribute is added to the <span class="object-name">panelPopup</span>, which uses the
backing bean value, as shown below.
</p>

<pre>
&lt;ice:panelPopup draggable="true" visible="#{popup.visible}"/&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The next step is to add 2 buttons to the page; one for opening a popup and one for closing the popup. These would be similar to the following:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;ice:commandButton image="images/close.gif" action="#{popup.closePopup}"/&gt;
&lt;ice:commandButton value="Open a Popup" action="#{popup.openPopup}"/&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The backing bean methods for these buttons and visibility attribute must now be written. The code for this is simple; the open method would
toggle the visibility to true, and the close method would set it to false. For completeness, this is demonstrated below.
</p>

<pre>
    public void closePopup() {
        visible = false;
    }

    public void openPopup() {
        visible = true;
    }
</pre>

<p>
When these bindings and methods are complete, the page will allow opening and closing of the popup dialog, as can be seen in <span class="code-jsf">
advancedPanelPopup.jspx</span>
</p>

<div class="demo-instruction" >
    <h3>Download the demo:</h3>
    <ul>
<li>Download the panelPopup-advanced source code <a href="panelPopup-advanced-tutorial.zip">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
As you can see it is trivial to add complex components and dynamic functionality to a popup panel.
